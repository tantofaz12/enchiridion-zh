## 📚 About the *Enchiridion*

The *Enchiridion* was compiled by Epictetus's student, Arrian. It captures the core teachings of Stoicism in a concise manner. This work focuses on:

- Distinguishing between what is **controllable** and **uncontrollable**.
- Understanding the true source of **inner freedom**.

Its influence stretches from ancient Rome to contemporary practices in psychology, notably **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**.
